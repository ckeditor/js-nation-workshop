## Very important project!

Our PM has some new idea!!1 Content creation?! Editors? I did brief research, and knowing him we need something truly modular. That's why I chose CKEditor 5.

I prepped some skeleton to get started.

1. This project uses Vite (experimental on CKE5 side but works great).
2. They are fully written in TypeScript right now!
3. Plugin based architecture, ðŸ¤ž it will help with our scope creep!
4. _Never_ trust the PM!
5. Good luck!

## Meta

To start working run the `./meta/scripts/reset.sh` (chmod it first if needed). It will setup the starting structure of the workshops. If you will need to jump to any stage, run the `npm run reset <stage>` command where stage one of `start / act-i / act-ii / act-iii / act-iv / act-v / bonus`.

To start Vite and the dev server run `npm run dev`.
