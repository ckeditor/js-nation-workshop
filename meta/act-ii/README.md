# Very important project!

Our PM has some new idea!!1 Content creation?! Editors? I did brief research, and knowing him we need something truly modular. That's why I chose CKEditor 5.

I prepped some skeleton to get started.

1. This project uses Vite (experimental on CKE5 side but works great).
2. They are fully in TypeScript right now!
3. Plugin based architecture, ðŸ¤ž it will help with our scope creep!
4. *Never* trust the PM!
5. Good luck!
